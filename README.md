A Python (2.6+) module for reading Standard Data Format (SDF) and ASCII
files saved by HP/Agilent Dynamic Signal Analyzers (DSA).

The HP/Agilent 35670A Dynamic Signal Analyzer has the ability to save
files as either SDF or ASCII format.

## HP/Agilent DSA ASCII Format

Four files are created when saving to the HP/Agilent DSA ASCII format:

1. `.HDR` contains SDF header information
2. `.TXT` contains the y-axis information, preserving the same units as
   displayed on the analyzer screen when the trace was saved
3. `.X` contains the x-axis information
4. `.Z` contains the z-axis information, if the trace contains waterfall
   data

Source: Agilent discussion forum question [When I save the trace in the
ASCII format, there are 4 files created with extensions of .txt, .hdr,
.x, and .z. What are the contents of these files?][1]

## Contributing

[sdfascii][] is developed using [Scott Chacon][]'s [GitHub Flow][]. To
contribute, fork [sdfascii][], create a feature branch, and then submit
a pull request.  [GitHub Flow][] is summarized as:

- Anything in the `master` branch is deployable
- To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of
  `master` (e.g., `new-oauth2-scopes`)
- Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same
  named branch on the server
- When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for
  merging, open a [pull request][].
- After someone else has reviewed and signed off on the feature, you can
  merge it into master.
- Once it is merged and pushed to `master`, you can and *should* deploy
  immediately.
